Automatically make YouTube videos, Google Maps and other embedded iframe items responsive

== Description ==

**You don't need to do anything! Just install and go!**

Responsive Embeds works by wrapping iframe elements with an HTML `<div>` via jQuery, and then applying some groovy CSS

== Installation ==

The quickest and easiest way to install is via the `Plugins > Add New` feature within WordPress®. But if you must, manual installation instructions follow...

1. Download and unzip the latest release zip file
2. If you use the WordPress plugin uploader to install this plugin skip to step 4
3. Upload the entire plugin directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
4. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress Administration

== Software Requirements ==

In addition to the [WordPress® Requirements](http://wordpress.org/about/requirements/), Responsive Embeds requires the following:

- jQuery v1.12.4+ (this comes with WordPress®)
